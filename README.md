TP TicketsPartners
TP TicketsPartners is a decentralized platform for creating events and selling tickets, focused on security, convenience and transparency.

The project is implemented as a Web App inside Telegram, which allows you to instantly launch events and sell tickets right in the messenger, without the need to install additional applications. In the future we plan to expand to iOS, Android and create a full-fledged website.

ðŸ”§ Technology Stack:
Arweave - for long-term storage of event and ticket data.

Metaplex - for creating and managing NFT tickets.

Solana Pay - for fast, cheap and secure payments on the Solana network.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals:
Simplify the event creation process for organizers.

Provide participants with full transparency and protection against fake tickets.

Use Web3 capabilities for decentralized management and storage of information.

TP TicketsPartners is a step towards the future of the event industry where tickets are NFT and all data is accessible and securely stored forever.
